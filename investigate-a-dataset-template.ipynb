    "This project will provide an analysis of the movies data from TMDB. I will analyse the data to determine the attributes that are associated with popular movies. I will also perform data cleaning operations to extract the information that is relevant to my project. I will also plot visualizations to illustrate my findings better and in the end i will provide a conclusion of my findings. "
