I will also perform data cleaning operations to extract the information that is relevant to my project. I will also plot visualizations to illustrate my findings better and in the end i will provide a conclusion of my findings. "

After gathering the data, I went on to clean and trim the dataset by removing zero and duplicated values and other columns which were irrelevant to my research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Then I answered the few of the questions I had, using pandas. I also plotted a few charts to visualize the results. The main attribute I used in the plots was `vote_average`. In those visualization I discovered that-: a. movies where higher costs were incurred are also rated high by users, b. movies that are highly rated by viewers have more revenue than their counterparts."
